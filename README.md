## Installing

Binaries are now available for Windows and Linux! (macOS users are going to have to wait a bit as I get a working VM) 
Check it out [here](https://github.com/UnsignedArduino/CircuitPython-Bundle-Manager/releases).

### Release notes for v1.1.0
You can get the v1.1.0 release 
[here](https://github.com/UnsignedArduino/CircuitPython-Bundle-Manager/releases/tag/v1.1.0).

Changes:
- Added a new `Detect` tab to automatically detect dependencies, saving a couple clicks! (Still very new, so report an 
  issue if there are problems!)

### Installing from a binary

No installation is required! (Well, there is no installer. You are still going to have to create a shortcut/symlink to 
it somewhere and extract it if you are using the directory-based executable)

These binaries were built with [PyInstaller](https://www.pyinstaller.org/).

#### Using the one executable:

1. Download the latest binary from [here](https://github.com/UnsignedArduino/CircuitPython-Bundle-Manager/releases).
2. Put it somewhere. On Windows, I would put it in `C:\Program Files\CircuitPython Bundle Manager`. On Linux, I would 
   put it in `/usr/bin`.
3. Create a shortcut/symlink to it on the desktop!

Note: If you are having trouble with the one-executable, try the one directory method!
##### Pros of the one-executable
* Convenient - you only need to deal with one executable.
* Easy to install - just place the executable somewhere and create a shortcut.
##### Cons of the one-executable
* Takes quite a while to start compared to the one-directory method.
* Needs to execute code out of the temporary directory, which sometimes isn't allowed on Linux.
* If the application crashes, the support code won't be deleted, so it will take up disk space until the OS clears it.
* Needs more space than the one-directory method.

#### Using the one directory:
1. Download the zip/tar.gz file from [here](https://github.com/UnsignedArduino/CircuitPython-Bundle-Manager/releases).
2. Extract it. 
3. Place the directory somewhere convenient. On Windows, I would put the extracted files and directories in 
   `C:\Program Files\CircuitPython Bundle Manager`.
4. Create a shortcut/symlink to `CircuitPython Bundle Manager.exe`. (`CircuitPython Bundle Manager` on Linux) It is in 
   the top directory.

##### Pros of the one directory:
* Fast - all the support files are ready, no need to extract them like in the one-executable method.
* Less space - needs less disk space then the one-executable method.
##### Cons of the one directory:
* Slightly annoying to install. 

You can find a detailed description of the one-directory method 
[here](https://pyinstaller.readthedocs.io/en/stable/operating-mode.html#bundling-to-one-folder) and a description of 
how the one-file method works 
[here](https://pyinstaller.readthedocs.io/en/stable/operating-mode.html#bundling-to-one-file).

### Installing from source

1. [Download](https://git-scm.com/downloads) and install Git. It does not matter what editor you use for Git's default.
    1. Or...download this repo via the `Download ZIP` option under the green `Code` button, shown in Figure 1.1:
    
    ![A picture on the Download Zip button on the GitHub page](assets/1/1.png)
    
2. [Download](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and install Python **3.9**. (Because I use type definitions, but 3.8 
   seems to work too)
    1. Make sure to check `Add Python 3.x to PATH`, as shown in Figure 1.2:
       
       ![A picture of the Python 3.9 installer with the Add Python 3.9 to PATH checkbox checked](assets/1/2.png)
       
    2. Make sure to also install Tk/Tcl support! If you can access the IDLE, then Tk/Tcl is installed, as shown in 
       Figure 1.3: (Only applies if you are using the `Customize installation` option in the installer)
       
       ![A picture of the Python 3.9 installer with the tcl/tk and IDLE checkbox checked](assets/1/3.png)
   
       If you are building Python,
       [here is a guide on building Python on Debian I found helpful](https://linuxize.com/post/how-to-install-python-3-8-on-debian-10/).
       Before building, you may need to install a bunch of packages using `apt`: 
       `sudo apt install libbz2-dev libgdbm-dev libgdbm-compat-dev liblzma-dev libsqlite3-dev libssl-dev uuid-dev libreadline-dev zlib1g-dev tk-dev libffi-dev`.
       
3. If you are on Windows, I would also install the 
   [Windows Terminal](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/windows-terminal/9n0dx20hk701) while you are at it.

4. If you installed Git, `cd` into a convenient directory (like the home directory or the desktop) and run:
    ```commandline
    git clone https://github.com/UnsignedArduino/CircuitPython-Bundle-Manager
    cd CircuitPython-Bundle-Manager
    ```
    1. If you downloaded the ZIP, move the downloaded ZIP to somewhere convenient (ex. home directory or desktop), 
       extract it, open a terminal and `cd` into the extracted directory.

5. If you run `dir` (or `ls` on Mac and Linux) you should get something like this:

    1. `dir` (Windows):
    
    ```commandline
    01/18/2021  08:11 PM    <DIR>          .
    01/18/2021  08:11 PM    <DIR>          ..
    01/18/2021  08:11 PM    <DIR>          bundle_tools
    01/18/2021  08:11 PM            39,625 gui.py
    01/18/2021  08:11 PM    <DIR>          gui_tools
    01/18/2021  08:11 PM               329 main.py
    01/18/2021  08:11 PM             1,949 README.md
    01/18/2021  08:11 PM                18 requirements.txt
                   4 File(s)         41,921 bytes
                   4 Dir(s)  x bytes free
    ```

   2. `ls` (macOS and Linux):
    
    ```commandline
    bundle_tools  gui.py  gui_tools  main.py  README.md  requirements.txt
    ```

6. If you are going to use a [virtual environment](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html), run the following 
   commands:
    1. Windows:
    ```commandline
    python -m venv .venv
    ".venv/Scripts/activate.bat"
    ```
    2. macOS and Linux:
    ```commandline
    python3 -m venv
    source .venv/bin/activate
    ```

7. Install the packages:
    1. Windows:
    ```commandline
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
    2. macOS and Linux:
    ```commandline
    pip3 install -r requirements.txt
    ```

8. You should now be able to run it!
    1. Windows:
    ```commandline
    python main.py
    ```
    2. macOS and Linux:
    ```commandline
    python3 main.py
    ```

## Running
If you installed from a binary, then just run the `CircuitPython Bundle Manager.exe` (`CircuitPython Bundle Manager` 
macOS and Linux) file. You may want to create a shortcut/symlink to it on the desktop or create a menu entry. If you 
would like to submit an icon, you can open an issue for it with the icon. 

If you install from source and you are not using a virtual environment, then you can just create a `.bat` file containing 
`python \path\to\the\main.py` (`python3`, forward slashes, and use `.sh` for the extension on macOS and Linux) on the 
desktop for convenience. Otherwise, you will need to re-activate the virtual environment everytime you want to run it. 
I highly recommend using these shell scripts:

1. Windows:

```batch
:: Replace this with the path to the directory of the CircuitPython Bundle Manager, should have main.py in it
cd path\to\the\CircuitPython-Bundle-Manager
:: You can use python.exe or pythonw.exe - the w one will just supress output of the program
".venv\Scripts\pythonw.exe" main.py
```

2. macOS and Linux:

```shell
# Replace with the path to the CircuitPython Bundle Manager
cd path/to/the/CircuitPython-Bundle-Manager
.venv/bin/python3 main.py
```
Don't forget to give the `.sh` file execute permission! (`chmod +x shell_file.sh`)

## How to use

### First run
On run, you should get something like this:

> If the GUI looks different from these images, it's because I don't want to update all these images. I will only 
> update the relevant images. (So if I add something in the example, Bundle Manager, then I will include new 
> instructions on how to use it, I won't be updating all the images that show the Bundle Manager.) The functionality 
> _should_ still be the same.

Figure 2.1: Start up on Windows.

![A picture of the CircuitPython Bundle Manager on Windows](assets/2/1.png)

Figure 2.2: Start up on Debian. (To be honest, Tk doesn't look that _great_ on Linux...)

![A picture of the CircuitPython Bundle Manager on Debian](assets/2/2.png)

> Note: From now on, I will be exclusively showing pictures of the CircuitPython Bundle Manager on Windows unless there 
> are Linux-specific instructions. The interface is _exactly_ the same.

What you want to do is to authenticate yourself and update the bundle so you can install modules. You can do it several 
ways:
1. Use your username and password
2. Use a GitHub token
3. Use a GitHub Enterprise URL and a login/token

Use the radio buttons (boxed in Figure 1.3) to select your method of authentication.

Figure 2.3: The radio buttons used to select the method of authentication. 

![A picture of the CircuitPython Bundle Manager's authentication method selector boxed](assets/2/3.png)

If you used your username and password, type in your username and password. (Labeled `1` in Figure 1.4)

If you used a GitHub access token, paste it in. (Labeled `2` in Figure 1.4)

If you used a GitHub Enterprise URL and a login/token, paste those in. (Labled `3` in Figure 1.4)

Figure 2.4: The methods of authentication labeled. Since I selected `Username and password` in the authentication 
method selector, I can only type in the `Username` and `Password` boxes.

![A picture of the CircuitPython Bundle Manager highlighting the different methods of authentication](assets/2/4.png)

Once you fill those in, make sure the version listbox (boxed in figure 2.5) has the correct version of CircuitPython 
you plan to use. If it does not exist or is too old, you will get an error shown in figure 2.6. If you input some bad 
credentials, you will get an error shown in figure 2.7. 

Figure 2.5: The version listbox boxed. 

![A picture of the CircuitPython Bundle Manager boxing the version selector](assets/2/5.png)

Figure 2.6: The error you get when inputting a bad version. Sadly, CircuitPython 7 doesn't exist. (yet)

![The error box shown when you input a bad CircuitPython version](assets/2/6.png)

Figure 2.7: The error you get when inputting bad credentials.

![The error box shown when you input bad credentials](assets/2/7.png)

Press `Update bundle`, and if all goes well, you should get a happy info message shown in Figure 1.8:

> Note: You will need a working internet connection for this!

Figure 2.8: The info box when the bundle updates successfully.

![The information box shown when the bundle successfully updates](assets/2/8.png)

That is it! Continue to 
[selecting a device](#selecting-a-device).

[Back to table of contents](#table-of-contents)

### Selecting a device

At the bottom of the UI, there is a section which will be shown regardless of the tab selected. This is where you can 
select your CircuitPython device, as shown in Figure 2.9:

Figure 2.9: The drive selector highlighted.

![A picture of the CircuitPython Bundle Manager's drive selector boxed](assets/2/9.png)

If you click on the downwards facing arrow in the entry box (labeled `1` in Figure 2.10) a small menu will pop up. It 
will most likely be empty unless you have a CircuitPython device connected, or you have `Show all drives?` checked. 
(Labeled `3` in Figure 2.10, and shown in Figure 2.11) The reload button (labeled `2` in Figure 2.10 reloads a handful 
of things, including what drives are connected, so if you don't see your drive, click it!)

Figure 2.10: Various parts of the drive selector labeled.

![A picture of the CircuitPython Bundle Manager's various parts of the drive selector labeled](assets/2/10.png)

Figure 2.11: More drives are shown with the `Show all drives?` checkbox checked. You will most likely not need this 
checked.

![A picture of the CircuitPython Bundle Manager's drive menu populated with non-CircuitPython device drives](assets/2/11.png)

On Linux (and macOS too - I think) it will look slightly different. Instead of drive letters, a path will be shown, 
like in Figure 2.12:

Figure 2.12: The drive selector on Linux.

![A picture of the CircuitPython Bundle Manager's drive menu populated with non-CircuitPython device drives on Debian](assets/2/12.png)

The CircuitPython Bundle Manager searches for drives in `/media`. If your OS does not mount drives there, follow these 
instructions:
1. Connect a CircuitPython device.
2. Mount the device if necessary.
3. Get the path of where the device was mounted. For example, `/media/pi/CIRCUITPY`.
4. Switch to the `Other` tab and click on `Open config file`.
5. Change the value of `unix_drive_mount_point` to the parent directory of the path of the device.
   
   Figure 2.13: My configuration file after modifying it:
   
   ![A picture of the CircuitPython Bundle Manager configuration file on Debian](assets/2/13.png)
6. Click the refresh button
7. Select the device!

That is it! Continue to 
[managing modules](#managing-modules).

[Back to table of contents](#table-of-contents)

### Managing modules

This is the fun part! (Well, not really) Here you can view the modules you can install and the modules already 
installed on the selected CircutiPython device! Figure 2.14 shows an anatomy of the `Bundle Manager` tab:

Figure 2.14: An anatomy of the`Bundle Manager` tab.

![A picture of the CircuitPython Bundle Manager's Bundle Manager tab's elements boxed](assets/2/14.png)

1. (Blue) This is the search bar - typing in it will filter out modules that don't have that string inside it. 
   (Uses Python's `in` keyword)
2. (Green) This is where you where can scroll through the list of modules you can install - will reflect the contents 
   of the most recent bundle **on your machine**. If it's blank, try pressing the reload button and updating the bundle!
3. (Red) This is the list of installed modules on the selected CircutiPython device - after selecting a new one, press 
   refresh!
4. (Orange) If a module is selected in the bundle and there is a selected device, then you can install to it!
5. (Pink)  If a module is selected in the list of installed modules and there is a selected device, you can uninstall 
   it!

Let's say I wanted to install the `simpleio.mpy` module . First, I could either scroll through the list to find 
`simpleio` or use the search bar to search up `simpleio`, like in Figure 2.15:

Figure 2.15: Using the search bar to find the `simpleio.mpy` files. 

![A picture of the CircuitPython Bundle Manager's Bundle Manager tab open with simpleio in the search bar](assets/2/15.png)

If it succeeds, you get an information box like in Figure 2.16:

Figure 2.16: Success!

![An information dialog saying "Successfully installed module!"](assets/2/16.png)

And in Figure 2.17, you can see it successfully installed!

Figure 2.17: Look, it's in the list of installed modules now!

![A picture of the CircuitPython Bundle Manager's Bundle Manager tab open with simpleio in the search bar and in the list of installed modules](assets/2/17.png)

Oh never mind, we didn't need the `simpleio` module. To uninstall it, click on `simpleio.mpy` in the list of installed 
modules and press `Uninstall`!

Figure 2.18: Uninstalling the `simpleio.mpy` file.

![A picture of the CircuitPython Bundle Manager's Bundle Manager tab open with simpleio in the search bar and in the list of installed modules and the simpleio.mpy file is selected in the list of installed modules](assets/2/18.png)

Figure 2.19: We see that it has been successfully uninstalled!

![An information dialog saying "Successfully uninstalled module!"](assets/2/19.png)

That is it! Continue to 
[keeping the bundle updated](#keeping-the-bundle-updated).

[Back to table of contents](#table-of-contents)

### Keeping the bundle updated

Follow the instructions provided in 
[first run](#first-run). You only need to do this once a 
day, since the bundle is updated once a day at ~12PM EST.

TL;DR:

1. Make sure you have a working internet connection.
2. Select method of authentication.
3. Input credentials.
4. Select CircuitPython version.
5. Press `Update`!

[Back to table of contents](#table-of-contents)

### Automatically detecting imported modules

> Note: This feature is still very new! Problems? 
> [Report an issue!](https://github.com/UnsignedArduino/CircuitPython-Bundle-Manager/issues/new)

Instead of scrolling through the bundle or using the search bar, why not save a couple more steps and have the 
CircuitPython Bundle Manager automatically detect dependencies for you? Figure 2.20 shows the `Detect` tab:

Figure 2.20: The `Detect` tab in the CircuitPython Bundle Manager.

![A picture of the CircuitPython Bundle Manager's detect tab open](assets/2/20.png)

If you have a CircuitPython device selected and there is a valid code file (One of `code.txt`, `code.py`, `main.txt`, 
`main.py`) you can press the `Detect` button to have the CircuitPython Bundle Manager parse the code files and look at 
your import statements. I'm using [this example](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-airlift-featherwing-esp32-wifi-co-processor-featherwing/internet-connect#connect-to-wifi-3035277-4:~:text=%23%20SPDX%2DFileCopyrightText%3A%202019%20ladyada%20for%20Adafruit,print(%22Done!%22)) 
from the Adafruit Airlift Featherwing Internet Connect guide from the Adafruit Learn site. If you click on one of the
modules and it's in the bundle, the `Find in bundle` button will light up. Pressing it will teleport you to the Bundle
Manager allowing you to click `Install`!

Figure 2.21: After clicking on `adafruit_requests` in the listbox and pressing `Find in bundle`, I was teleported here! 

![A picture of the CircuitPython Bundle Manager's bundle Manager's tab open with adafruit_requests selected](assets/2/21.png)

[Back to table of contents](#table-of-contents)

### Other

Figure 2.22: The `Other` tab in the CircuitPython Bundle Manager. The interface may change and I will probably forget 
to change this too.

![A picture of the CircuitPython Bundle Manager's other tab open](assets/2/22.png)

- `Open README file` opens this file locally with the default `.md` program. If it cannot find it, it will attempt to 
  download it from GitHub.
- `Open README file location` opens the location of the README file in the default file manager.
- `Open config file` opens the configuration file in the default `.json` program.
- `Open config file location` opens the location of the config file in the default file manager.
- `Open log file` opens the log file in the default `.log` program.
- `Open log file location` opens the location of the log file in the default file manager.
- `Open GitHub repo link` opens the repository in the default browser.
- `Copy GitHub repo link` copies the link to this repository on GitHub to the clipboard.
- `Open an issue` opens the new issue panel in the default browser.
- `Copy link to open issue` copies the link to the new issue panel. 

[Back to table of contents](#table-of-contents)

## Options
You can find these options in `config.json`, which is in the same directory as 
[`main.py`](https://github.com/UnsignedArduino/CircuitPython-Bundle-Manager/blob/main/main.py), and should be 
auto-generated upon first run. In case it does not happen, (file a issue?) this is the default JSON file:
```json
{
    "last_auth_method_used": "username and password",
    "last_circuit_python_bundle_version": "6",
    "show_traceback_in_error_messages": "false",
    "unix_drive_mount_point": "/media"
}
```
- `last_auth_method_used` should be a string of `username and password`, `access token`, or `enterprise`. This is the 
  last method of authentication you used.
- `last_circuitpython_bundle_version` should be a string of a number. This is the last CircuitPython version you used.
- `show_traceback_in_error_messages` should be a string of a bool. (Like `1`, `true`, `yes` for `True` and anything 
  else for `False`) This will control whether stack traces will appear in error messages.
- `unix_drive_mount_point` should be a string of a path that points to the place where your distro automatically mounts 
  drives. Only applies to Unix-based systems.

If you want to reset the config file, either delete it or clear the contents of the config. If you want to reset just 
one option, remove it from the configuration file.
